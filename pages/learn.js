        <p>The tarot (/ˈtæroʊ/, first known as trionfi and later as tarocchi or tarock) is 
        a pack of playing cards, used from the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to 
        play games such as Italian tarocchini, French tarot and Austrian Königrufen, 
        many of which are still played today. 
        In the late 18th century, some tarot decks began to be used for 
        divination via tarot card reading and cartomancy leading to custom decks developed 
        for such occult purposes.[1]
